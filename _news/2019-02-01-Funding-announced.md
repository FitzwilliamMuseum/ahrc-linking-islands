The [Fitzwilliam Museum](/partners/fitzwilliam-museum/) and the [Open University](/partners/open-university/) have been awarded funding from
the [Arts and Humanities Research Council](https://ahrc.ukri.org) (AHRC) under the [UK/USA Research Network](https://ahrc.ukri.org/funding/apply-for-funding/archived-opportunities/research-networking-highlight-notice-for-uk-us-collaborations-in-digital-scholarship-in-cultural-institutions/) call, to work with trans-Atlantic partners to study the Classical World and build
capacity to support the '[Being an Islander: Art and Identity of the large Mediterranean Islands](https://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/being-islander-art-and-identity-large-mediterranean-islands)' exhibition to be held between October 2021
and February 2022 in the Fitzwilliam Museum.

This new exhibition will showcase representative objects from the Aegean and Cypriot Collections of the Fitzwilliam Museum. It will also incorporate a number of important national and international loans. The exhibition will provide a platform to debate cultural evolution in the islands as opposed to the surrounding mainland. This theme will be explored in an interactive way, extending to the discussion of Britainâ€™s own (perceived or not) island identity.

This research network will see scholars from world-renowned institutions ([The J. Paul Getty Trust](/partners/the-getty/), [Institute for the Study of the Ancient World](/partners/institute-for-the-study-of-the-ancient-world/), [Brown University](/partners/brown-university/), [Open Context](/partners/open-context/), [American Numismatics Society](/partners/american-numismatics-society/), the [Pelagios Project](/partners/pelagios/), [University of London](/partners/school-of-advanced-studies/) and [King's College London](/partners/kings-college-london/)) come together 3 times in Cambridge, Los Angeles and Providence to work on a diverse range of technologies and problems that are common areas of concern.

The network will build upon the legacy of the **[Linked Ancient World Data Institute's](http://dlib.nyu.edu/awdl/isaw/isaw-papers/7/)** ground breaking 2012 and 2013 workshops in New York and New Jersey, high-level expertise of our academic institutions and draw upon the experience of scholars who led the highly successful Pelagios project to become infrastructure for a panoply of Classical Archaeology projects.
