The Fitzwilliam Museum and the Open University have been awarded funding from
the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) under the UK/USA Research Network call, to work with trans-Atlantic partners to study the Classical World and build
capacity to support the '[Being an Islander: Art and Identity of the large Mediterranean Islands](https://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/being-islander-art-and-identity-large-mediterranean-islands)' exhibition to be held in October 2021.

This research network will see scholars from world renowned institutions (The J. Paul Getty Trust, Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, Brown University, Open Context, University of London and King's College London) come
together 3 times in Cambridge, Los Angeles and Providence to work on a diverse range of technologies and problems that are common areas of concern.

The network will build upon the legacy of the Linked Ancient World Data Institute ground breaking 2012 and 2013 workshops in New York and New Jersey, and draw on the experience of scholars who led the highly successful Pelagios project to become infrastructure for masses of Classical Archaeology projects.
