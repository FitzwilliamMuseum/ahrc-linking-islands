On the 16 October, an AHRC UK/USA-funded workshop will be will be held at St. Edmund’s College to showcase, discuss and bring together Classical World projects that work with Linked Open Data and other methodologies (3D imaging, visualisations, mapping) to enhance and aggregate museum collections. This event will provide insight and discussion which will help the Fitzwilliam Museum with its digital designs to complement the Fitzwilliam Museum's 2021 exhibition: Being an Islander: Art and Identity of the large Mediterranean Islands.

The event will see papers from the partner organisations (Open University, the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (New York University), Brown University, the Getty, Pelagios, Open Context, the School of Advanced Study and the American Numismatics Society), but there will be space for lightning talks from delegates (fees waived) if you would like to propose a topic.  

Conveners of this event are Daniel Pett, Dr Anastasia Christophilopoulou, and Dr Elton Barker (Open University) and the project is generously funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) and can be found under grant number AH/S012478/1.

£10 per person, lunch and coffee included.

Programme to be announced shortly. 

Tickets can be booked via the [University of Cambridge](https://onlinesales.admin.cam.ac.uk/conferences-and-events/fitzwilliam-museum/linking-islands-of-data/linking-islands-of-data).
