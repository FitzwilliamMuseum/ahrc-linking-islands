The Second Linking Islands of Data Symposium, 5-6 MARCH 2020

St John's College & The Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge

Following an initial workshop in October 2019, which brought together representatives
of Classical World projects that work with Linked Open Data and other methodologies
(3D imaging, visualisations, mapping), we are pleased to announce a two-day long
symposium with the aim of enhancing and aggregating museum collections.

This event is open to all researchers, as well as software developers, Museum professionals and independent scholars.
Structured around a series of position papers, extended discussion, and group activities,
this event will provide a road map for enhancing accessibility, interaction and
collaboration between cultural institutions that share similar challenges with
the archaeological, historical and Museum data.

### Questions to discuss:
1. What added value can Linked Open Data bring to museum exhibitions and research
projects? The case of Fitzwilliam Museum’s 2021 Being an Islander: Art and Identity
of the large Mediterranean Islands exhibition, its digital ‘footprint’ and ‘object biographies’.
2. What is Linked Open Data and how can we do it? The case of the Pelagios Network,
its annotation platform Recogito and prototype search (Peripleo).
3. What role can the creative economy play in museum collections and exhibitions?
The case of Museum in a Box and 3D work.
4. What insights can be gleaned from big institutional initiatives? The case of
the Getty Museum (e.g. the new digital CVA volume, the Antiquities Provenance
Project and the Ancient Worlds Now initiative) TBC
5. What resources are needed? The case of the The Cyprus Gazetteer TBC
