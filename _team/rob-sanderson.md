Dr. Robert Sanderson is the Semantic Architect for the J Paul Getty Trust, with
responsibility for the design and direction of cultural heritage data information
systems spanning the Museum, Research Institute, Conservation Institute and
Foundation.

His main goal is to find the right balance between ease of publication and
consumption of data, and the precision of the dataâ€™s semantics. Ongoing projects
include the publication of the Museum and Research collections via IIIF (iiif.io)
and Linked Open Data, with the model and process being documented at
https://linked.art/.

He is chair of the JSON-LD work in the W3C and proposed chair for the W3C Art &
Culture community group, is a specification editor and community leader in the
IIIF community (http://iiif.io/), and on the advisory boards of many projects in
the cultural sector including the American Art Collaborative and Annotating All
Knowledge projects. In his previous position as Standards Advocate at Stanford
University, he was involved in the BibFrame ontology with the Library of
Congress and many semantic digital library projects. He has also been a Research
Scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and a lecturer in Computer Science
at the University of Liverpool.
