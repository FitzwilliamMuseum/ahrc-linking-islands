I am Director of the Alexandria Archive Institute, the non-profit organization
that supports Open Context. I have a Ph.D. in archaeology and have spent 20+ years
conducting zooarchaeological research in the Old World. I am Vice-President of
the International Council for Archaeozoology, and participate in the Publications
Committees of the Society for American Archaeology and the American Schools of
Oriental Research.

For Open Context, I provide overall project management for publications, work on
data editing and review, manage collaborations with other publishers, and
organize peer-review. I also tweet for Open Context @opencontext.
