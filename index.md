**Linking Islands of Data** will create a research network based around centres of excellence that study the Classical World on both sides of the Atlantic and build upon the legacy of the National Endowment for Humanities funded Linked Ancient World Data Institute.

This network will focus on classics, archaeology, epigraphy and museology and create a variety of digital and analogue outputs - including an application programming interface (API), documentation and guidance for best practice in the use of Linked Open Data and high resolution document handling - using established and emergent technological methods and communities of practice based around 3 workshops held at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Brown University and Open Context.

These research project web pages will document our progress, host examples of what
we generate and provide an archive of activity.

This project which is generously funded by the [Arts and Humanities Research Council](https://ahrc.ukri.org/) (AHRC) and can be found under grant number AH/S012478/1.
