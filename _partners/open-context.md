Open Context is a free, open access resource for the Web publication of primary
field research from archaeology and related disciplines. It made its debut in
2006 as a means for scholars and students to easily find and reuse content created
by others – key to advancing research and education. Open Context’s technologies
focus on ease of use, open licensing frameworks, data integration and, most
importantly, data portability.

The AAI maintains Open Context and provides editorial oversight for its content.
Open Context has been funded by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the
National Endowment for the Humanities, the Institute of Museum and Library
Services and, most recently, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.
