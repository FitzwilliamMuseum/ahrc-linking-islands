Located in historic Providence, Rhode Island and founded in 1764, Brown University is the seventh-oldest college in the United States. Brown is an independent, coeducational Ivy League institution comprising undergraduate and graduate programs, plus the Alpert Medical School, School of Public Health, School of Engineering, and the School of Professional Studies.

With its talented and motivated student body and accomplished faculty, Brown is a leading research university that maintains a particular commitment to exceptional undergraduate instruction.

Brown’s vibrant, diverse community consists of about 6,580 undergraduates, 2,255 graduate students, 545 medical school students, more than 6,000  summer, visiting, and online students, and more than 700 faculty members. Brown students come from all 50 states and more than 115 countries.

Undergraduates pursue bachelor’s degrees in 81 concentrations, ranging from Egyptology to cognitive neuroscience. Anything’s possible at Brown—the university’s commitment to undergraduate freedom means students must take responsibility as architects of their courses of study.

Brown University has 51 doctoral programs and 32 master’s programs. The broad scope of options vary from interdisciplinary opportunities in molecular pharmacology and physiology to a master’s program in acting and directing through the Brown/Trinity Repertory Consortium.

Additional programs include the Undergraduate Summer Session and Pre-College Programs for high school students — on campus, online, and abroad.

Brown is frequently recognised for its global reach, many cultural events, numerous campus groups and activities, active community service programs, highly competitive athletics, and beautiful facilities located in a richly historic urban setting.
