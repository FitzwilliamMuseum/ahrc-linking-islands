Portolan chart of the Aegean Sea and part of the Eastern Mediterranean (Maps.Ms.Plans.697)
Cambridge University Library possesses no other original examples of this rare and important type of early maritime chart. The story behind the unearthing of our sheet is of particular note as it was acquired, quite by accident, amongst a miscellaneous collection of some 200 Turkish maps purchased in 1969. A very welcome surprise!
